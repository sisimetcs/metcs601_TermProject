        <div class="bio">
            <p>Sisi was born into a musical family. When she was four years old, she began learning piano from her
                grandmother who is a fantastic music teacher. She
                started participating in piano competitions when She was 8 years old and obtained the
                certificate of Chinese National Piano Grade Exam - Grade 10 when she was 12 years old.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>After she went to college, she joined the
                music department of the Students' Union and devoted herself to the school's music
                events. She and her colleagues built a club for students who love music and offered them more
                opportunities to show their talent. In the meantime, she became a certified examiner of the
                Chinese Piano Grade Exam. Based on her good performance at College, Professor John Thomsen referred her
                to
                teach piano at Piano Academy. After receiving some training from the principal Christie Skousen, she
                became
                a licensed teacher. She customized the lesson plan based on every student`s character. Moreover, she was
                so
                honored to have received the “teacher of the year“ award from Piano Academy once.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>She started pursuing her Master degree in
                Music at San Francisco State University with scholarship in 2021. Her mentor is distinguished pianist
                and
                professor - Dr. <!-- Hyperlink -->

                was fascinated by world music which she later received the Michael Segrove Avalos Award
                in the competition of Hispanic music.
